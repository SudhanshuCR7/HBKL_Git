A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos


Why is CDN used?
The primary goal of a CDN is to improve web performance by reducing the time needed to send content and rich media to users. CDN architecture is also designed to reduce network latency caused by hauling traffic over long distances and across several networks.

The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request. Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.

What is difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN?
The development build is used - as the name suggests - for development reasons. You have Source Maps, debugging and often times hot reloading ability in those builds. The production build, on the other hand, runs in production mode which means this is the code running on your client's machine.
